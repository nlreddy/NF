            <h3>The Cow: Heart of Natural Farming</h3>
            <p>
                In traditional Indian agriculture, the cow is revered not only as a sacred animal but also as a cornerstone of sustainable farming. At our Gaushala, we nurture indigenous cow breeds whose contributions go far beyond milk.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gomutra & Panchagavya:</strong> Natural bio-enhancers used for soil fertility and pest control.</li>
                <li><strong>Cow dung:</strong> A vital ingredient in composting and Jeevamrut, enriching soil with microbial life.</li>
                <li><strong>Zero Budget Natural Farming:</strong> Cows enable farming without chemical inputs, reducing costs and improving health.</li>
                <li><strong>Spiritual and Cultural Value:</strong> Cows symbolize abundance, patience, and harmony with nature.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our Gaushala is not just a shelter—it’s a living lab for regenerative agriculture, education, and community connection. Every cow here is part of a larger ecosystem that supports farmers, students, and the soil itself.

            <h3>The Role of Nandi (Oxen) in Natural Farming</h3>
            <p>
                In Subhash Palekar’s Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF), a pair of indigenous oxen is considered essential for maintaining a self-sustaining farm ecosystem. These majestic animals are not just draft power—they are living contributors to soil health and farm vitality.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ploughing & Aeration:</strong> Oxen gently till the soil without disturbing its microbial life, unlike heavy machinery.</li>
                <li><strong>Jeevamrut Preparation:</strong> Their dung and urine are key ingredients in microbial-rich bio-enhancers.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> They reduce dependency on fossil fuels and external inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Spiritual Symbolism:</strong> Nandi represents strength, patience, and harmony in Vedic tradition.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Sustainability:</strong> A pair of oxen can manage up to 30 acres, making them ideal for small and medium farms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                At our farm, the Nandi pair is honored as co-workers in the field—respected, cared for, and integrated into every aspect of our regenerative practices.
